### Background

From the Forest is a full service agency and incubator for SaaS startups. Our strength stems from our experienced and opinionated set of generic services that are boradly applicable to most SaaS companies.  We build them genericly so that we can boostrap high quality projects quickly. Our core services are developed in template repositories and then cloned for our customers.  

Customers then are free to either update the repositories themselves - or work with us to make the changes nessesary to get their SaaS into the market. 

### What is the playbook?

The playbook our guideing principles for building, operateing, and interacting with clients.  

The value we provide to clients directly comes from these generic and opinionated services. We are experienced experts with these services, and have developed strong opinions on the best tools, architectures, and processes for SaaS companies. it is very important to keep good documentation on the reasoning behind these decisions.  We document those reasons and justify our opinions in this playbook.  

The goal of these core services is to provide a high jumping off point for customization.  We are not a cookie-cutter agency - but we prefer to focus our efforts on what makes your SaaS unique rather than re-inventing the wheel.
